OSMM Topography Layer Styling
============
## Update
This tool was created for use with data loaded using the ProductivitySuite software. ProductivitySuite is due for retiement at the end of the year and the new UK Data Loader from Esri UK will automatically add these fields to the data when loading it.


## About
This style tool can be run against your OS MasterMap Topography data to create and calculate the fields and values for applying the correct styles. The data needs to have been loaded using Esri UK's ProductivitySuite software to work as it relies on the data schema created by that tool.

Once you have run the tool there will be two new columns in your data which can be used in conjunction with the layer files supplied by the Ordance Survey in their [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OSMM-Topography-Layer-stylesheets/tree/master/Schema%20version%209/Stylesheets/ESRI%20stylesheets%20(LYR)).

When running a COU on the data you will need to remove these columns so they do not interfere with the load, the toolbox provides you with a tool to do this.

## Quickstart

A toolbox is included in this repository and can be used to run the tool. Download the repository zip file and extract it to disk. Then add the toolbox to the ArcToolbox list so it can be run. (If you are using a version of ArcGIS for Desktop older than 10.3 then please use the OSMMStyle101 toolbox.)

The style tool takes 3 parameters:

- The geodatabase containing the data
- The table prefix used when loading the data
- The tool mode. This will be either "Add Style" to add and create the required styles or "Remove Columns" to delete any style columns already added.

The python scripts can also be run using the batch file included in the repository.
